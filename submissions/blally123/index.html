            <h2>How I got into Yo-Yoing</h2>
                <p>When I was young I had played with a yo-yo here and there but never actually gained
                    any skill at it, until my freshmen year of college. I went home for springbreak to stay with my parents and
                    happend upon my old yo-yo -- which I hadn't touched in years -- with my newfound young-adult levels of coordination I quickly
                    picked up on many tricks.  I soon found that getting out of bed and throwing a few yo-yo tricks was a great way to wake myself
                    up in the morning, after those late nights of writing long lab reports.  To this day I have been actively
                    yo-yoing for about 5 months now, so it didn't take long for me to pick it up at all.

                    <h2>Why should anyone Yo-Yo?</h2>
                    <img = src ="images/7PMzY.gif" alt = "Victim from YoYoExpert forums"/>
                    <p>Yo-Yoing serves as a means of physical challenge without the phyical toll or danger usually associated with that -- atleast
                        most of the time anyways --
                      for anybody who enjoys challenging themselves on the go with very little downtime, the Yo-Yo is a good choice.
                  I'm not going to tell anybody that they should or should not Yo-Yo, but if you asked me I would tell you that you should
              atleast give it a try, regardless of how dumb you may thing it is you can deny the satisfaction associated with getting
          the object to return to your hand.</p>

                <img src="images/pou6Lav.jpg" alt="my yoyos"/>
                <p>I currently have about 13 or so yo-yos, which to somebody without
                any experience with yo-yo's may sound like large number to have, but
                in reality a majority of people who yo-yo have quite a large collection, as each yo-yo is slightly different than one another.
                I find them much more novel to collect than things such as trading cards, as each individual yo-yo can be played with and each yo-yo plays
                differently from one another.</p>

    <h1>My Future as a Yo-Yo Dude</h1>
        <p>I want it to be clear that I do not ever intend on joining the circus or anything, but for the sake of having it as a hobby, I expect
        for my yo-yo throwing to continue for years to come.  I enjoy yo-yoing for the challenge involved in learning "that next trick",
        for the sheer difficulty involved in some yo-yo tricks it gives me great satisfaction to land my most difficult tricks cleanly.</p>
